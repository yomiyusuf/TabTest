# TabTest

#
The project was Implemented using the Android architechture componets with the MVVM pattern.
This enable proper seperation of concerns

Dagger2 was used for the dependency injection.
Retrofit was used to compose the network request
RXJava was used for the asynchronous network calls

Basic network error handling was implemented to notify the user of network problems.

Please, note that the Details activity displays the same data irrespective of whic city is tapped on the list.
This is due to the limitation of the  sample endpoint used.
